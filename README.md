# Grid Coloring App

The Grid Coloring App is a simple program that allows users to interactively color squares in a grid. Users can click on squares to toggle between green, red, and white colors. The grid state is persisted between sessions, allowing users to save their progress.

## Usage

1. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:
   - [Download for Windows](https://github.com/ManasGn5/8x50-Grid/releases/download/Grid/grid.exe)

2. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded file to run the application.

ðŸŸ¢Please NOTE that some antivirus software may flag the application as potentially harmful due to it being relatively unknown. However, the Grid Coloring App is open-source and has been thoroughly reviewed for security. We assure you that the application is safe to run. If you encounter any issues or have concerns, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mail2averma@gmail.com).

ðŸŸ¢Please NOTE that the program makes a file to save your edits the first time this action might be blocked by your antivirus so until you allow it to run from your antivirus's history of actions it wont store the changes you make on grid.

Enjoy coloring your grid!
